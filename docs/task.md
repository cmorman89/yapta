# Task Module

## Overview
The `Task` class serves as the primary data structure for individual tasks. It holds essential task information, such as task name, description, due date, priority, and completion status. The `Task` class offers methods for updating these attributes as the task evolves, with the exception of `task_id`, which is immutable for data integrity.

## Attributes
- **task_id** (`UniqueId`): The unique identifier for each task, generated by the `UniqueId` class upon task creation.
- **task_name** (`str`): A brief title for the task.
- **description** (`str`): Detailed information about the task. Optional.
- **due_date** (`str`): Expected completion date, intended to be updated to a `Date` object.
- **priority** (`str`): The priority level of the task. Future plans include updating this to an enum with classifications (e.g., `None`, `low`, `med`, `high`, `immediate`).
- **complete** (`bool`): Indicates whether the task is completed. Defaults to `False`.

## Methods
- **update_name(title)**: Updates the task name. Returns `self` for chaining.
- **update_description(description)**: Updates the task description. Returns `self` for chaining.
- **update_due_date(due_date)**: Updates the due date. Returns `self` for chaining.
- **update_priority(priority)**: Updates the priority level. Returns `self` for chaining.
- **toggle_complete()**: Toggles the completion status of the task. Returns `self`.

### Design Choices
The `Task` class was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing chaining for ease of use. The `task_id` is immutable for data integrity, ensuring that each task is consistently identifiable by a unique identifier.
